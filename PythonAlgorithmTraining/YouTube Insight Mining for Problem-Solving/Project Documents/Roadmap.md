### **📌 Roadmap Item: Add Tracking Metrics for Evaluating Recommendation Improvement Over Time**

#### **🎯 Objective**

To measure the effectiveness of the **YouTube Insight Mining for Problem-Solving** project by tracking how well YouTube recommendations align with the intended learning goals over time.

---

## **🛠️ Key Metrics to Track**

### **1️⃣ Engagement Metrics** _(Evaluates how well the algorithm is responding to automated interactions)_

- **% of videos related to targeted industries/topics** in recommendations
- **Increase in watch time** for relevant videos
- **Change in click-through rate (CTR)** for recommended content
- **Like-to-view ratio** on suggested videos

### **2️⃣ Relevance Metrics** _(Measures the quality of recommended content)_

- **% of videos that match predefined learning categories**
- **% of recommended videos from high-quality channels**
- **Change in diversity of industries featured in recommendations**
- **Ranking of high-value videos in search results (before vs. after automation)**

### **3️⃣ Automation Effectiveness Metrics** _(Tracks whether the automation is improving recommendations as intended)_

- **% of videos in playlist added automatically vs. manually**
- **Time spent training the algorithm vs. manual curation needed**
- **How often irrelevant recommendations appear (before vs. after)**

### **4️⃣ Iterative Learning & Adaptation Metrics** _(Ensures continuous refinement of the automation process)_

- **Comparison of recommendations across different time periods** (weekly/monthly)
- **Changes in content themes based on automation adjustments**
- **Correlation between engagement actions (likes, comments) and better recommendations**

## **⏳ Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Baseline Data Collection (Week 1-2)**

- **Manually document** the current **state of YouTube recommendations**
- Identify **relevant vs. irrelevant** content ratios before automation

### **Phase 2: Implement Automation & Begin Tracking (Week 3-4)**

- Start **automating video interactions (watching, liking, adding to playlists)**
- Compare **YouTube’s recommendations before and after automation**

### **Phase 3: Optimize & Adapt (Month 2-3)**

- **Adjust engagement actions** (watch time, likes) to reinforce better content
- **Refine keyword inputs** for API-based searches to improve content discovery

### **Phase 4: Long-Term Performance Analysis (Month 3-6)**

- Track **week-over-week trends** in recommendation quality
- Measure the **sustainability of improvement** in learning content over time
- Evaluate whether **manual intervention is decreasing** as automation improves

## **📂 Tools & Techniques for Tracking**

✅ **Python Logging & Data Storage** – Store recommended video URLs over time  
✅ **YouTube API** – Fetch top recommended videos before & after each phase  
✅ **Power BI Dashboard** – Visualize trends in YouTube recommendations  
✅ **Automated Reports** – Export weekly/monthly trend analysis

## **📌 Expected Outcomes**

🎯 More **relevant YouTube recommendations** aligned with problem-solving goals  
📈 Measurable **improvements in content relevance & engagement**  
🧠 Reduced need for **manual content curation**, as automation optimizes the process
